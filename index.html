  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

  <ul>

    <li>500g ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat is ideal for juiciness)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
    <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
    <li>4 slices of cheese (optional)</li>
    <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
    <li>Tomato slices</li>
    <li>Onion slices (raw or grilled, your choice)</li>
    <li>Pickles (optional)</li>
    <li>Ketchup, mustard, and/or mayonnaise (for toppings)</li>
    <li>Butter (for toasting buns)</li>
    <li>Cooking oil or butter (for frying patties)</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>

 <ol>

   <li>Prepare the patties: Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and gently shape them into patties. Press a small indentation in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up during cooking. Season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
   <li>Cook the patties: Heat a skillet or grill over medium-high heat with a little oil or butter. Cook the patties for 3-4 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or longer if you prefer them well-done. If you're adding cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking and cover with a lid to let it melt.</li>
   <li>Toast the buns: While the patties are cooking, spread butter on the cut sides of the buns and toast them in another pan or on the grill until golden brown.</li>
   <li>Assemble the burgers: Start with the bottom bun, add a lettuce leaf, then the patty (with or without cheese), followed by tomato slices, onions, and pickles. Top with your favorite condiments, then place the top bun.</li>
